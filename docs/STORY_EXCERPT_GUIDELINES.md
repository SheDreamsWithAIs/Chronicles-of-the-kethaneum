# Story Excerpt Writing Guidelines for Chronicles of the Kethaneum

## Overview

Each puzzle in Chronicles of the Kethaneum represents one excerpt from a "book" in the Kethaneum library. Every genre contains multiple books, and each book follows a 5-part narrative structure based on K.M. Weiland's story beat principles.

**Core Principle**: Even though each excerpt is brief (2-3 sentences), it should contain a complete mini-story structure with:
- **Goal**: Something the character/subject is trying to achieve
- **Conflict**: An obstacle, tension, or challenge preventing easy achievement
- **Resolution**: A moment of change or progression that propels the larger story forward

---

## The 5-Part Story Structure

Each book has 5 story parts (indexed 0-4) that map to the classic narrative arc:

| Part | Story Beat | Purpose | Scene-Level Focus |
|------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **0** | The Hook/Introduction | Establish the world, introduce stakes | Show the ordinary world with hints of what's to come |
| **1** | Rising Action/Complication | Introduce challenges and obstacles | Present the inciting incident or first major obstacle |
| **2** | Midpoint Twist | Major turning point or revelation | Shift from reaction to action; raise the stakes |
| **3** | Climactic Moment | Peak tension and confrontation | Show the character facing their greatest challenge |
| **4** | Resolution/Epilogue | Conclusion and new equilibrium | Demonstrate change and hint at the future |

"The Amazon rainforest receives over 80 inches of rainfall each year, yet somehow its soil remains surprisingly poor in nutrients—a paradox that would doom most ecosystems. The secret lies in rapid recycling: when a leaf falls, specialized fungi and insects break it down within days, returning nutrients directly to the living trees through shallow root networks. This delicate balance means the rainforest literally grows on top of itself, a living cycle where death immediately becomes life."

**Words**: rainforest, rainfall, leaf, fungi, nutrients

**Analysis**:
- Presentation: Paradox of poor soil in lush forest (creates curiosity)

Isaac Newton's revelation changed everything: gravity doesn't just pull objects down—it reaches across the void of space, invisible and unstoppable. The Moon pulls on Earth's waters with enough force to lift billions of tons of seawater twice each day, a cosmic dance that has shaped coastlines and species for millions of years."

**Words**: Moon, tides, gravity, ocean, Newton

Fire still burned in mortal hearths, knowledge still grew in mortal minds, and the age of absolute divine rule had ended the moment Prometheus made his choice."

## Writing Best Practices

### 1. **Word Selection Strategy**

Your 5-6 puzzle words should:
- **Appear naturally** in the excerpt (avoid forced inclusion)
- **Match the theme** of the story part
- **Vary in difficulty** (mix common and uncommon words)
- **Create connections** (thematically related to enhance immersion)

**Example**: For a pirate adventure excerpt, use: ship, treasure, captain, compass, island (not: ship, apple, telephone, democracy, molecule)

---

### 2. **Length and Pacing**

- **Target**: 2-3 sentences (50-80 words)
- **Maximum**: 100 words
- **Minimum**: 40 words

**Pacing by Story Part**:
- Parts 0-1: Moderate pace, world-building
- Part 2: Quicken pace slightly, raise tension
- Part 3: Fastest pace, urgent action
- Part 4: Slower reflection, resolution

---

### 3. **Sensory Details**

Include at least **one sensory detail** per excerpt:
- Visual: "the lantern's amber glow"
- Auditory: "branches creaking warnings"
- Tactile: "clutching the ancient map"
- Olfactory: "the scent of old parchment"
- Gustatory: "bitter taste of fear"

---

### 4. **Emotional Resonance**

Every excerpt should evoke **one clear emotion**:
- Part 0: Curiosity, anticipation
- Part 1: Concern, intrigue
- Part 2: Surprise, realization
- Part 3: Tension, fear, excitement
- Part 4: Relief, satisfaction, bittersweet reflection

---

### 5. **Avoid Common Pitfalls**

**DON'T**:
- ❌ End on a cliffhanger every time (save for Parts 1-2)
- ❌ Over-explain (trust the reader)
- ❌ Use clichés ("It was a dark and stormy night")
- ❌ Include words unnaturally just to fit the puzzle
- ❌ Make every excerpt action-packed (vary the rhythm)

**DO**:
- ✅ Create complete micro-moments
- ✅ Imply larger context
- ✅ Use strong, specific verbs
- ✅ Show character through action/reaction
- ✅ Honor genre conventions while staying fresh
