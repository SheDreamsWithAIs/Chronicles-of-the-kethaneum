Story Blurb 1: The Book of Passage

The crystalline cover of your Book of Passage warms uncomfortably under your fingertips, as if it too were flushed. It pulses in time with your own rapid heartbeat. You look down at it, expecting to see the clean transparency of a blank page.

Instead, words bleed into existence on their own. It captures your feelings, chronicling your deepest reactions in jagged, messy script:

Humiliation...

The cold floor against your cheek when you should have walked into glory...

The stiffened silence of your first expectations dying...

You watch as it transcribes your disappointment and disorientation in real-time. It captures the nausea rolling in your stomach and the fear that you have already failed before you have truly begun. As disconcerting as transit was, it was not the most disorienting part. It seems the portal's glitch didn't just rattle your bones. It shook your thoughts loose, spilling them directly onto this page...

Story Event 1: Lumina’s Warning (First arrival)

Lumina is watching you. Her eyes drop to the crystalline cover in your hand, which is still faintly glowing. It glows with the heat of your inscribed emotions. Then she looks back up to your face. Her expression shifts to calculated knowing.

"Careful, Archivist," she murmurs, stepping between you and the prying eyes of the junior staff. "You haven't learned to control your connection to the Book."

She taps the cover of your book with two out of 6 of her long, slender fingers.

"The Book of Passage does not merely record history; it is linked to your essence. In these early stages, before you learn to discipline your mind, it will transcribe everything. Your history, your observations... and your vulnerabilities."

She leans in slightly, her tone shifting from the kindly warmth of mentor to the guarded hush of conspirator.

"Keep it close. And to most… keep it closed." She chooses her next words carefully, "Tension in the Kethaneum has become... sharp. You do not want your doubts read like a public notice by those looking for weakness."

Satisfied that you understand the gravity of the tool in your hands, she straightens up, returning to her professional persona.

"Now, Archivist, to business." A wry smile graces her lips and amused wrinkles cluster around the edges of each of her three eyes. "Yes, I said Archivist. Do not forget that you have earned that distinction. You are here to do a job. Not sightsee. You work here now." She gives you a smile of pride before returning to business.

"The modernization efforts have disrupted more than transits. The Archives themselves are… straining. Words are being lost, meanings scrambled. We need every available archivist working to catalog and stabilize the texts." She glances out towards the infinite corridors spanning the endless expanse of knowledge. "Venture deeper into the archives and the Kethaneum will bring the wounded texts to you. Do not worry. You know how to catalog the texts. This is what you have studied for. May knowledge smile on you and our combined efforts elevate you."

Lumina sends you out into the archives.
