If all the knowledge that was and had ever been was yours, what would you do with it? 

Is sharing in knowledge its own reward? Or is being the keeper of it the prize? 

[Action Button: What do you desire?]

These thoughts cross your mind as your Book of Passage grows warm against your palms. You begin transit. Excitement mingles with the strange tactile sensation of reality bending in ways you hadn’t conceived possible. This is the culmination of an entire career’s worth of work—your life’s goal. The new sensations should comfort you, like a mantle of accomplishment. Instead the mantle sits awkward and off-center, like a garment that has ridden up uncomfortably but still technically fits. Unease creeps up your spine…

The discomfort builds as the warmth of transit turns sharp and erratic. Your Book of Passage pulses irregularly in your hands. In a more stable version of reality, its pages could be described as rustling with what sounds like distress. The shifting gateway that should shepherd you smoothly between realms begins to stutter and spark. Reality fractures at its edges like glass under pressure.

Then it stops.

[Action Button: Come back to the present, roughly]

Not gracefully. Not with the gentle settling promised in every song, story, and telling of Kethaneum arrival. The portal simply… gives up. One moment you’re suspended between worlds; the next you’re deposited unceremoniously onto polished floors that look like they are inlaid with stars. The transit leaves you in a tangled heap of limbs and wounded dignity.

You slowly extract yourself from the sprawl, dusting off robes meant to make a good first impression. Gradually, you become aware you’re not alone. Acutely aware. From the quality of the silence, whatever conversation was happening before your arrival died a very sudden death…

Then the voices return. Shapes against a field of stars is all your mind registers as it remembers how vision is supposed to work... On one side, the tone is sharp with frustration. But on the other, it is wearily dismissive.

[Action Button: Listen cautiously]

"—third malfunction this rotation," someone hisses, genuine worry threading through their tone. "The transit matrices aren't supposed to fluctuate like that. People could be hurt, or worse, lost between realms entirely."

"Honestly..." comes the reply, half sighed. The response carries that particular brand of exhaustion reserved for explaining the obvious to the willfully stupid. "As Luminos has stated... repeatedly, this is just growing pains from the new efficiency adjustments. There's no cause for concern. The Kethaneum is an ancient and complex structure. Modernization requires some temporary instability." The words sound practiced as does the dismissive tone that accompany them.

“Temporary?!” The first voice rises, incredulous. “It never failed before the modernization efforts.” The statement cuts across the tension like claw marks. No longer hiding irritation, they continue, “How many rotations of this have happen before we call it—”

[Action Button: Avoid drawing attention]

An abrupt younger voice interrupts. They speak with the confidence of someone who's never been wrong about anything critical. "Exactly like I keep saying. Some people are just too scared of change." With the conviction of someone who's back is turned toward a large warning sign, they continue. "This lot is stuck in the archaic past like Elara. Always wanting to keep the Kethaneum trapped in a lesser—"

The swift "SHHH" cuts across the room like a slap. Angry glares from both of the arguing parties focus on the junior member. The ambient tension in the room rose with swift intensity as their slip carelessly careened into sensitive territory. The intruding statement dies on their tongue under the weight of collective rebuke. Both sides fall silent. The silence that formed in the span of blink solidified with such speed and finality that you can practically hear the sound as it crystallizes.

Silence presses against your ears like the weight of deep water, but in it is the first true lull since the transit began. You attempt to arrange yourself with something resembling dignity. Your ceremonial robes - carefully chosen for this momentous first day - rustle against the polished floor. Now you can better see that they sparkle like cosmic crystal. An endless sea of stars star back you from whatever impossible material the floors are made of.

Yet, your attention is drawn away by every head in the chamber turns toward you in perfect sunchronization.

[Action Button: Stare back awkwardly] 

The silence stretches. Eyes dart between you, each other, and then back to you again. Someone clears their throat softly. Another shifts their weight from foot to foot. The air feels thick, expectant. Yet no one dares to bridge the distance or properly break the silence.

Another young staff member attempts to open their mouth, as if to speak. But the words die a speedy death under the withering look from an older colleague. Without a word, they sofly close their mouth again maintaining the almost tangible silence.

Then, as soon as the hush settles, footsteps echo from a corridor beyond. The footfalls are measured, purposeful as they grow steadily closer. The sound breaks whatever spell holds everyone frozen in place.

"Lumina! Tighten up," someone hisses urgently under their breath, barely audible.

Like a flock of startled birds, staff scatter in every direction. With practiced efficiency, they suddenly find themselves engrossed in their tasks. Documents shuffle. Equipment becomes fascinating. Every eye, regardless of how many the being possesses, finds anything to look at except you, each other, or the person approaching.

[Action Button: Quickly make yourself presentable]

The footsteps stop in front of you in the form of a dignified-looking woman. Her species is unknown to you. Like most bipedal beings you know, she has two arms and legs, a single head, and soft black hair gathered up. However, she has three triangular eyes that look at you with such piercing insight part of you questions if your very essence has been punctured. 

"Welcome to the Kethaneum. You have achieved what many only dream of." Despite her initially stern apperance, her voice is warm, but authoritative. It carries easily across the reception chambers speaking to many times of commanding a room upon arrival. You know from the deep purple robes she wears that she is senior faculty. This must be the mentor, the Senior Archivist, you were expecting to greet you. 

Despite, her focus on the task at hand, the frantic avoidance energy in the room is not lost on her. Her eyes sweep the room. She gives everyone the kind of comprehensive glance that still misses nothing, no matter how brief it is. But then her gaze settles on you with genuine warmth.

"I am Archivist Lumina. I apologize. I meant to be here to greet you on arrival, but an unexpected... situation detained me." As Lumina pauses, glances are exchanged between the formerly arguing staff members. Beneath the surface, the same fault lines from earlier reflect in their eyes. Between allies knowing looks pass while glares silently attack each other across the line between the two groups.

Lumina continues. "Come, let's examine your Book of Passage then head deeper into the library."
